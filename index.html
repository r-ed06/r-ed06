                    aging, and earning the little money I could with online poker, as it allowed a flexible schedule
                    that
                    I needed. These
                    people have passed by the time I was 25.

                    encountered your youtube application forms. And I suddenly realised, that this would be a dream to
                    be able to contribute to the podcasts I am so passionate about (my friends are probably tired of me
                    mentioning them constantly). Never even considered that it would

                    reviewing an
                    existing podcast in the format you would prefer as a trial, I am up for it! I am confident that I
                    could help with research,
                    highlighting quotes, make lists of interesting moments for the editor to consider, make summaries of
                    future guest previous podcasts, the topics they covered, and any
                    other small technical tasks that can help the podcast.

                    inquiries.
                    Looking forward to it! And if this application doesn't lead anywhere, I at least want to
                    <strong>thank you</strong>
                    and your staff for making the world a better place, one fascinating discussion at a time.
